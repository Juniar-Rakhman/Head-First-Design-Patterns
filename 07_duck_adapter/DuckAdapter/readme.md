# Duck Adapter Sample

- [Duck interface](Duck.java)
- [Mallard Duck](MallardDuck.java)
- [Turkey interface](Turkey.java)
- [Wild Turkey](WildTurkey.java)

Now, let's say you're short on Duck objects
 and you'd like to use some Turkey objects in their place.
Obviously we can't use the turkeys outright because they have a different interface.

- [Turkey adapter](TurkeyAdapter.java)
- [Test drive the adapter](DuckTestDrive.java)
