# Design Principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them (**encapsulate** it) from what stays the same
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation. Program to an interface really means Program to a **supertype** (abstract class or interface)
3. Favor **composition** over inheritance
4. Strive for **loosely coupled designs** between objects that interact
5. **Open-Closed** Principle: classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
